# My coding playground
This is where I practice javascript.

### Contents:
- codeWars
- codefights
- DailyProgrammer
- wesbos 30 days
- interview questions
- hundreds of mdn js questions (JS-exercises, WIP)
- small apps that do stupid things in the browser that will never get deployed

### Spin it up:

```
$ git clone 'theurl'
$ cd code-log
$ http-server
```

*If webpack exists, look at its readme and follow the directions there.*  
*Otherwise most of this can be seen through that http-server.*  
*Navigate to an HTML file, then open the dev tools.*  
*If no HTML, I logged the function directly in the IDE.*
