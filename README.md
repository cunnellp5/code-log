* Playground

> This is a large repository for loads of practice problems taken from several different resources. This is for my personal interest.

*** Contents:
- codeWars
- codefights
- DailyProgrammer
- wesbos 30 days
- interview questions
- hundreds of mdn js questions (JS-exercises, WIP)
- small apps that do stupid things in the browser that will never get deployed

*** Spin it up:

```
$ git clone 'theurl'
$ cd codewars-log
$ http-server
```

> If webpack exists, look at its readme and follow the directions there. Otherwise most of this can be seen through that http-server. just navigate to whatever HTML file and open the dev tools. If no HTML, I logged the function directly in the IDE.
