My code is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

>Without me, my code is useless. Without my code, I am useless. I must write my code true. I must write more accurately than my enemy who is trying to find bugs. I must solve it before it creates technical debt. I will ...

### Contents:
- codeWars
- codefights
- DailyProgrammer
- wesbos 30 days
- interview questions
- hundreds of mdn js questions (JS-exercises, WIP)
- small apps that do stupid things in the browser that will never get deployed

### Spin it up:

```
$ git clone 'theurl'
$ cd code-log
$ http-server
```

*If webpack exists, look at its readme and follow the directions there. Otherwise most of this can be seen through that http-server. just navigate to whatever HTML file and open the dev tools. If no HTML, I logged the function directly in the IDE.*
