# ANSWER (B)log

> This has become a blog style repository of 'hw' answers. A personal endeavor to learn JS.

### Concepts:
- Basic animations
- Linking basic css, html, and vanilla JS
- Basic JS functions
- Webpack
- Basic architecture
- Understanding fundamentals
- Scope and nuances of simple JS
- DOM manipulation

---

#### Kick it off:

```
$ git clone (url)
$ npm install
$ npx webpack -w (use npx to run locally, that way you dont have to down load it globally)
$ lite-server OR $ http-server (how ever you want to spin up html files in the browser, webpack did a build and is watching for changes)
```

To add more pages:
- Create a new .js file under `./src/exercises` and copy and paste the template. Fill in the blanks
- Then register the file in the main.js
  - If webpack is watching just refresh the page
